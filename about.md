# Julissa 
Hello, my name is Julissa. I am currently a senior at NYU majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Web Programming and Applications. My path into CS began through front-end, which makes front-end very special to me. The first CS class that I ever took at NYU was Intro to Web Design, and it changed my life completely.
