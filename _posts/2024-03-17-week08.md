# This is actually happening
Contributing to a project is still nerve-wrecking. Are they going to accept the suggestions? Will they respond? Will they simply close the issue without a clear explanation? What are the guidelines to how to contribute to a project? These are a few of the questions that are running through my group's and mine minds as we began to contribute. We decided that our first contribution was going to be documentation.

# Importance of documentation
We noticed that for Spicetify documentation was there but not often updated or given much emphasis. Perhaps, it was because not a lot of issues surround the documentation portion. We also noticed that there wasn't a lot of issues to begin with. Most pull requests are updates for the repo and those are done by the maintainers. The maintainers are usually quick to look at their pull requests and accept it. Our first pull request was to change the broken links and update links. Surprisingly, it was accepted immediately. They even suggested to add another link to a broken link that they found in the contributing file. This was extremely convenient and helpful to the future and even current Spicetify community. I then created a suggestion to a code of conduct. Unfortunately, they misunderstood by explanation for a code of conduct for a contributing file and they simply closed the issue. 

# Learnings and How to Improve on Contributions
This mishap of the issue being closed prematurely didn't and will not disencourage me. Rather it helped me understand that it is vital to be clear in explanations and the importance of why I think it is important to add something. Furthermore, perhaps a code of conduct is not what they wanted for the project! Either way these were a few of our contributions for the "first" (but not really first) week with working in the Spicetify community! 

<br/>
We hope that we can continue to contribute to the Spicetify community! We really noticed that they are active on Discord so perhaps to grab their attention we can communicate what we are doing on Discord! 

See you next time, <br/>
