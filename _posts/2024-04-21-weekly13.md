# Study Banger First Version is Almost Up
We have had a lot of progress this week, and I believe we are almost done with the application. For the most part, everything is almost done. We are currently working on the backend and connecting it to the frontend. We have the page that is shown to people once they click on the Study Banger image on the sidebar. If they click on the side bar, they will see a button and an initation page. The page contains a book animation as well as a button on the top. The book animation is about a book opening up and then the button is meant to "turn on" the application. Once they click on the button, they will be brought to a different page that will have the albums. The albums are meant to help people study or become focused. The Starry Night theme is also done. We are trying to currently add the theme to application and fuse our two projects into one. Two challenges that we are having is connecting the backend to the frontend and adding the theme to the application. However, we believe these challenges will be solved by next week.
