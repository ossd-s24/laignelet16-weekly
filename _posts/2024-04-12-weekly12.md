# Our Progress: Closer to Creating a Full Application

> **_NOTE:_** Things are bound to change depending on the progress that you have on the project. Not everything will be perfect from the start but it is a matter of understanding where you can change to finish the final project! 

## ATTENTION: Change of Plans

In the beginning like I mention in my Week 11 blog, our plan was to create an extension. However, after we began to code and understand the code in order to develop an extension, we realized that what we wanted to create was more of an application. We also contacted the support system on Discord to make sure that it was more of an applicaiton instead of an extension and they did confirm. That made us change the repo that we were using and how we were going to code. Once we went to the application route, things went a lot more smoother. It was easier to change the sidebar and add in interactions.

## Setback
The only issue is the button at the top. There aren't applications that use the button at the top which makes it harder to understand where I can change in order to add a button at the top but I think I am close to figuring it out. If not, then we can add another functionality somewhere in the main page. We also have the image of the application to be placed to be done. It is going be geared toward the studying aspect with the word study in the middle and a book in the background. Our theme is also almost done! It just needs a few more updates before we can publish it and then we can do it more with it. We believe that we might be finished by next week. Things are going smoothly and I believe we will have a good final product to show to the class. 

Until next time,
